# Song of the Crescent Moon

Ocean Song Nidalee fanart. *Mobile devices may face performance issues.*

Made using HTML, vanilla JS, Sass, [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/), and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Heavily referenced [simeydotme's](https://github.com/simeydotme) Pokemon cards CodePen. He made a newer version with Svelte that runs silky smooth on every device I tried so check it out if you're interested.
